# The Gaia Theory
#### Duration: August'21 to September'21
Studied the modern version of the Gaia Theory and topics from System Sciences, which are crucial to understand a planet’s atmospheric and surface phenomenon, especially those affecting Earth's ecosystems. Reviewed scientific papers on theories suggesting possible bottlenecks faced for the evolution of life on a planet, focusing on the novel Gaia Bottleneck Hypothesis, seeking the answer to Fermi’s Paradox.
